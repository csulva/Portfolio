        <h2>About Me</h2>
            Hi and welcome to my portfolio! A little about me: I am a software engineer, experienced with Python, Flask web development, and am currently learning more JavaScript. As I do so, you may see this page improve. I also enjoy
            working in Amazon Web Services platforms and querying data in SQL and SQLAlchemy. Below you will find my portfolio projects. I enjoy all things music--playing, listening, collecting, as well as going to live shows. Golf and soccer are my favorite sports and they're how I spend most
            of my Sundays. Feel free to contact me with anything, or come back to see more added to my portfolio.
